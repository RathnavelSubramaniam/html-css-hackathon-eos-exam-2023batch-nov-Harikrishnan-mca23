Findings show that most of the cultural heritage assets were known in general but only few of the places were known as cultural heritage tourism sites. Main source of knowledge for majority was informal education and training programs in schools, colleges and universities. Moreover, mass media was considered as main means of promoting cultural heritage tourism.. However, public awareness creation strategies on available heritage assets were considered somehow effective as some sources which could be useful were inadequately accessible.  </h2>
